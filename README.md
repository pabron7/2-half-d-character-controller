### HOW DOES IT WORK?
* It reads 2 axis movement from "Horizontal" and "Vertical" axis
* Simply adds velocity to Player's rigid body. Speed can be edited through the inspector panel
* Tracks the ground under the player to jump. Upon landing on ground it refreshes the jumper count which can be edited through the inspector panel. Jumps can be kept short when the button is released during action.

### WHAT'S NEXT?
* Roll, Dash and Run functionalities
* 2D character Sprite and Animations
* State system

##### MAYBE
* hanging functionality
* melee and ranged combat
